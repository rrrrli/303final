        Deadly secrets that we wrote into screenplays; <br />
        Bike rides to the beach on sunny Saturdays. <br />
        When you whispered to me your hidden love for him; <br />
        And how you held me as my grief filled to the brim. <br />
        You stopped to see me, while others hurried through; <br />
        You walked alongside me, after others withdrew.

    <h1>Friendship and friendship quality in adolescence</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
      Adolescence is an important time period to form deep and close
      friendships. Friends who are close tend to have affection for each other,
      help each other, and spend time with one another.
      <br />
      <br />
      Having high-quality close friendships is important for adolescentsâ€™
      healthy development, as these friendships can increase positive emotions
      and reduce depressive symptoms.
      <br />
      <br />
      Although we know that having high quality friendships is important in
      adolescence and that adolescents tend to have higher friendship quality
      than children, little research has been done on how friendship quality
      changes over time, or whether the pattern of change in friendship quality
      over time may be different for boys and girls.

    <h1>Our data</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      Our study contains a group of adolescents &#40;n = 117&#41; who
      participated in our study for three times.
      <br />
      <br />
      At Time 1 &#40;T1&#41;, they are around 12 years old. They are 14 years
      old on average when they return for the Time 2 &#40;T2&#41; study, and 16
      years old at Time 3 &#40;T3&#41; of the study. We have roughly the same
      number of boys and girls in our sample.
      <br />
      <br />
      At all three time points, our participants filled out a Likert-scale
      measure named <em>Friendship Quality Questionnaire</em>, which assesses
      their friendship quality with a best or close friend. In this graph below,
      you can see how the distribution of friendship quality scores in our
      participants change from T1 to T3.

    <h1>Features of friendship</h1>
    <br />
    <br />
    <br />

    <p>
      A friendship can have both positive and negative features. Friendships
      with a lot of positive features and few negative features are considered
      to be <em>high-quality</em>.
      <br />
      Research has identified several different <em>positive features </em> that
      are indicative of friendship quality. This project aims to map out how do
      these specific features of friendship change throughout adolescence for
      boys and girls with some interactive visualizations. The features are:

      <a href="../subpages/sub3.html">validation</a>,
      <a href="../subpages/sub4.html">intimate exchange</a>,
      <a href="../subpages/sub5.html"> companionship</a>,
      <a href="../subpages/sub6.html"> help</a>, and
      <a href="../subpages/sub7.html"> conflict resolution</a>.
      <br />
      <br />

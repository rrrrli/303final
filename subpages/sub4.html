    <h1>Intimate exchange over time for boy and girls</h1>

      Intimate exchange is the action of sharing information that is private,
      secret, or emotional with a friend. Adolescents in intimate friendships
      tend to show higher social competency and emotional well-being. Girls are
      more likely to self-disclose emotions and seek emotional support than
      boys, which translates into higher levels of intimate exchange in
      friendships. One study has also found that late adolescent boys are likely
      to lose the intimate friendships they built in early and mid-adolescence,
      perhaps due to their increasing awareness and adherence to the
      stereotypical standards of male friendships that regard intimacy as
      feminine.

          Similar to what past research has found, girls tended to report more
          frequent intimate exchange with close friends than boys. Most girls
          reported medium-high to high levels of intimate exchange. For boys, it
          seems that levels of intimate exchange varied widely between
          individuals at T1 from as low as scores of 3 to 5 (17%) to higher
          scores of 12 and 13 (21%). This pattern persisted at T2, although now
          boys most commonly reported scores between 8-12 (around 40%). At T3,
          the distribution seems slightly bimodal, with a cluster of boys
          reporting scores of 7 and 8 (around 23%) and another cluster reporting
          scores of 11 and 12 (around 29%). These interesting changes in the
          distribution of boys’ friendship intimacy call for more detailed
          examination in research.
